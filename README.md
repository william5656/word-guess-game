functional hangman but you can enter any key which is bad for example: enter or backspace or the number 5
trying to fix

The html and css where pretty simple 
i just found some pictures added a background for the logo/ header 
used bootstrap/grid for the html 
added empty tags for empty boxes so i can plug in my js ex. guessleft and guessed words
